### Analyze A/B Test Results:
-----------------------------
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. This project is aimed at understanding the 
results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website and help the company understand if they should implement the new page, 
keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision. The project was written using Python3 on 
jupyter notebook.
